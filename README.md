# Project Overview

Collect the Apples is a Java Swing game where the player moves a basket to catch falling apples to win under a specific time limit.

# What the Project Does

The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move a basket and catch apples. Red apples increase the score, while green apples decrease it. The game ends when the player reaches the target score or runs out of time. Player scores and times are saved.

# How to Run the Program
- Make sure all .java files are in the same project.
- Run the AppleGame class.
- Log in or register to start playing.

# Project Goals / Purpose
The purpose of this game is to provide both an engaging and relaxing experience for the player. The players have the pressure of having to catch a specific amount of apples under a time limit, as well as the simple graphics to help destimulate. As for my goals, with this project, I wanted to practice Java GUI programming, collision detection, inheritance, and file handling.
